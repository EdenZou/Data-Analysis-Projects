'1 data getting' file contains a code file and a data file.

In code file, there are two python codes. In order to get the targeting information from Bilibili, we should run the 'bilibili_perfect_outside.ipynb' first and then 'bilibili_perfect_inside.ipynb'.

'bilibili_perfect_outside.ipynb' helps to get the title, link, author, view numbers of a video.
'bilibili_perfect_inside.ipynb' helps to get the collection number, reposts number and like number of a video.

The resulting data are stored in the data file.
